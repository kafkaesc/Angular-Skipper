This project is a demonstration of how to implement a reliable 'skip to main content' button using the Angular framework.

To run:
1. navigate to the project folder
1. `npm install`
1. `ng serve -o`

Beneath the main navigation menu is a sub-menu demonstrating different ways to allow keyboard users to skip to the main content of the site. So far only `[href]` calling a string from the component's TypeScript works as a reliable solution.
